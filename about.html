            <p class="lead">Masonic labor is purely a labor of love. He who seeks to draw Masonic wages in gold and silver will be disappointed. The wages of a Mason are in the dealings with one another; sympathy begets sympathy, kindness begets kindness, helpfulness begets helpfulness, and these are the wages of a Mason.<br /><br />- Benjamin Franklin</p>

                            <h3 style="display:inline">Fifteen Master Masons,</h3> who represented six different lodges in the area, met in early June of 1904 and signed a petition
                            for a new lodge of Masons to be formed in the village of Denham Springs. This was the beginning of Denham Springs Lodge No. 297 F. & A. M. The first
                            recorded meeting of this group of Masons was held at 9:30 A.M. on July 6, 1904. The lodge had not been chartered, so they met under dispensation from the
                            Grand Lodge of the State of Louisiana. District Deputy Grand Master John Puleston opened the lodge and was the installing officer for the first slate of
                            officers. Brother John Scott Underwood, who was recorded as being a member of Franklin Lodge No. 57, Franklin, LA, was installed as the first Worshipful Master.
                            The Lodge was chartered on February 7, 1905.

                            No time was lost in finding a home for the new lodge, for it was on May 20, 1905 that a cornerstone was laid. Information gathered from some of the older
                            citizens in Denham Springs indicate that the first lodge hall was located near the corner of Centerville and Main Street, which is now known as River Bend.
                            On June 21, 1911 the lodge building was destroyed by a fire. Meetings were held in the Denham Springs High School building under dispensation from the Grand
                            Lodge until early 1912, when the lodge found another location in a building on the corner of Centerville and Benton Street. Meetings were held in the existing
                            building at this location until a new building could be erected. In early 1914 a new two-story lodge hall was erected at a cost of $2,446.00.  In early 1971,
                            construction began on the current lodge hall at the same location. The new building was completed at a cost of under $50,000. The first meeting in the new hall
                            was held in August of 1971. Over the years, Denham Springs Lodge was called upon several times to assist in forming many of the lodges in the surrounding area.

                            Charity is the cornerstone of the Masonic Fraternity, and it is described as the brightest jewel in the Masonic Crown and its Corinthian pillar. The Masonic
                            history of Denham Springs Lodge records many acts of charity towards its members, other lodges in need of help, families of members, and the community. Perhaps
                            one of the most outstanding examples of that charity occurred in late 1951 when enough money was collected from lodge members to build a house for the widow and
                            children of a deceased brother who had been a member of the lodge.

                            Many years have passed since the original charter members brought Masonry to Denham Springs. Many dedicated Masons have contributed to the growth and success of
                            our lodge. Brothers of Denham Springs Lodge come from many different backgrounds and walks of life. They are united in friendship, morality, and brotherly love.
